### Key Features

* Nano utilizes a novel [block-lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice) architecture, unlike conventional blockchains used in many other cryptocurrencies.
* The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput.
* Offers instantaneous transactions with zero fees and unlimited scalability, making Nano an ideal solution for peer-to-peer transactions.
* As of August 2018, the Nano network has processed over twelve million blocks with an unpruned ledger size of only 4.6GB.
